# What is a bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser. They are stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. Bookmarklets are usually small snippets of JavaScript executed when user clicks on them. When clicked, bookmarklets can perform a wide variety of operations, such as running a search query from selected text or extracting data from a table.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
# How to use a bookmarklet.

An "installation" of a bookmarklet is performed by creating a new bookmark, and pasting the code into the URL destination field. Alternatively, if the bookmarklet is presented as a link, under some browsers it can be dragged and dropped onto the bookmark bar. The bookmarklet can then be run by loading the bookmark normally.




# 2023 update amd where I've been

Hi guys, I havent't updated this repository since 2022 and you guys have probably wondering where I have been. I have been very busy school work and other stuff. I am back and will now continue update this repository. Expect to see an update almost every Wednesday. Don't forget that if you are reading this to star this repository and tell your friends about this. I made this repository because I understand how boring, hard, and stressful school is and most of these bookmarklets are for you guys to have at least a little fun and improve your grades in websites like Edpuzzle and i-Ready. There is now a changelog at the bottom. ;)
